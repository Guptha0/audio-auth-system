**Backend API:** `http://localhost:8001` (when running locally)

## 📖 Overview

VoiceAuth 2.0 is a cutting-edge voice authentication system that combines advanced voice biometrics with AI-powered spoof detection. It addresses the critical security challenge: not just "who is speaking," but "is the speaker a live, authorized human?"

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional voice authentication systems are vulnerable to:
- **Replay Attacks** using high-fidelity recordings
- **Synthetic Voice Generation** via AI deepfakes
- **Voice Conversion** attacks

### 💡 Our Solution
A multi-stage voice biometrics system that integrates standard verification with dedicated anti-spoofing countermeasures.
